Schemacina Documentation Index
==============================

Schemacina (pronounced ski-meh-scene-ah on the West coast, ski-mack-Ä“-nah on the East) is a structured document parser for .NET with out-of-the-box support for HL7 and X12.

    Structured documents contain a series of delimited *segments* separated by a delimiter (typically a new-line or a special character). Each of the segments is then further split into fields/elements with a different delimiter, which may be split again by yet another delimiter, and so on.

Key features of Schemacina include lazy parsing of documents, mapping document contents to strongly typed object graphs, transforming documents, and formatting documents.
