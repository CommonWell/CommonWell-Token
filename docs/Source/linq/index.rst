LINQ to HL7/XML
===============

One of the most powerful features of Schemacina is the ability to query documents using LINQ. The power of LINQ (Language INtegrated Query) makes previously complex nesting and ordering issues easy to tackle compared to the normal mark and loop methods of accessing HL7/X12 documents. The features of LINQ make complicated pattern matches each to understand and the compositional nature allows commonly used access patterns to be created as extension methods for easy reuse.
